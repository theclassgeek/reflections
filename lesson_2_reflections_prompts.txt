What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The repository ".git" file is created and the containing folder can then be treated as a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the selected documents a user wants to commit.
Honestly, I don't see the value of partial commits at the moment...to save space, maybe? Who knows...
