What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The repository ".git" file is created and the containing folder can then be treated as a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the selected documents a user wants to commit.
Honestly, I don't see the value of partial commits at the moment...to save space, maybe? Who knows...

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
It  allows a final stage before enacting a new commit where you can see (a) the changes made to the working repository and (b) the changes since the last commit. Hence the commit message once a commit is done will note miss any information as the user can review all changes (some of which they may have forgotten between commits)

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When you want to split your program off into multiple delibertely different versions, but still be able to return to the original (/or another) branch to continue work

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They show easily map out each branch's variation from the "master" and from one another.
They also allow representation of how new features have been fit into the program.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The label to the non-master branch is removed - i.e. the master takes on all changes from the additional branch and all commits are listed as if they had taken place on the master branch.
The changes (i.e. the added fields) are kept in the resultant program
